        <p class="first">Hello everyone It's me again, Dinara. The answers of the educational grant competition were released today. And, yes, I did it, I received a grant from the prestigious university in Central Asia KBTU. I'm so glad I got over it. And I want to thank my family and friends for believing in me and supporting me through difficult times! Thank you all very much! And I wish you all the best!</p>

        <p class="second">Hello, friends! You can congratulate me! :) Because today is my birthday and I turned 18. Aoa-aa, I'm so happy! After all, now I can walk outside even after ten at night... But it's wrong to walk late into the night, but you can still be wrong sometimes... Okay, bye everyone, and I went to celebrate my 18th birthday!!</p>
